# Christian Financial Stewardship: A Developmental Model

Okay, here's a table illustrating how a Christian might approach financial management at each of the five levels of fathering identity development, drawing from the provided source on "Level of Identity Development.pdf":

# Levels of Fathering Identity Development in Christians

## Stage 1: Impulsive Fathering Identity

| Column | Content |
| :------ | :------ |
| **Level of Identity Development** | Stage 1: Impulsive Fathering Identity |
| **What they believe** | “I’m a dad when I feel like it.” Fathering is primarily guided by immediate reactions and societal norms rather than a deeply considered Christian framework. The focus may be on following basic parenting rules or what was modeled by previous generations without much personal reflection. |
| **How they relate with children** | Interactions with children are driven by immediate desires and emotions. Parenting decisions might be made to quickly address problems or to gain approval rather than from a thoughtful, principled approach. |
| **Examples of how punishment is conducted** | “Don’t irritate me or you are going to get it from me!” May punish based on immediate reactions to a perceived slight to self. Punishment may not be proportionate to the severity of misconduct, but more due to personal dissatisfaction with the child’s behaviour. |
| **Examples of how rewards is given** | “Daddy wants to play football on Saturday. No time for you….why don’t you take this $20 and go watch a movie on your own?” May give rewards out of selfish intentions, e.g., to feel good, or to present oneself from feeling guilty. |
| **Examples of how money management is done** | “Daddy - can I have this 20 cents I see on the ground?” “Ok sure”. May give money when they ask for it, focusing on instant gratification (for self or for child) without any lessons on budgeting or saving. May not see the need for or think too deeply about money management education for his children. |
| **How to encourage them to grow?** | The goal is to begin moving from a reactive and surface-level approach to fathering towards a more thoughtful and intentional understanding of Christian principles in parenting. |

## Stage 2: Imperial Fathering Identity

| Column | Content |
| :------ | :------ |
| **Level of Identity Development** | Stage 2: Imperial Fathering Identity |
| **What they believe** | “I don’t want to look bad as a father, but I will still stick to my own ideas of fathering, thank you.” Fathering starts to incorporate more personal interpretations of Christian teachings. There may be an emphasis on creating a stable environment for children based on a more idiosyncratic understanding of Christian values and expectations. |
| **How they relate with children** | Relationships with children are influenced by a personal desire to be seen as a good parent and to provide security and structure. The approach to parenting may prioritize personal convenience and satisfaction as well as meeting societal standards of fatherhood. |
| **Examples of how punishment is conducted** | “You know why you are punished - you should know better than to talk back at me in front of others. You made me lose face!” May punish to enforce standards that are self-serving, to make one look good in public. |
| **Examples of how rewards is given** | “Wah, your classmate got an ang pao for his good results? Let me do that, and also top up with an ipad!” May give rewards to look good in front of others. |
| **Examples of how money management is done** | “If you help Daddy to vacuum the floor, I will give you $20” May now see money as a means to an end, and so starts to introduce the idea of money management as a tool to achieve specific goals. Hence, he will set simple systems such as earning money through chores or saving a portion of allowance. The focus is on making sure these rules are followed. |
| **How to encourage them to grow?** | Development involves broadening the understanding of Christian fatherhood beyond personal benefit and working towards a deeper integration of Christian values into daily parenting practices. |

## Stage 3: In-community Fathering Identity

| Column | Content |
| :------ | :------ |
| **Level of Identity Development** | Stage 3: In-community Fathering Identity |
| **What they believe** | “I will take reference from what others I respect believe fathering should be.” Fathering is informed by a well-established Christian community and tradition. Parenting practices align with the values and expectations of the faith community, and the father’s role is understood within the context of broader Christian teachings. |
| **How they relate with children** | Relationships with children are shaped by communal norms and values. There is a strong sense of identity as a Christian father within the community, with an emphasis on adhering to traditional Christian roles and practices. |
| **Examples of how punishment is conducted** | “Why did you join in with the bullying? You are grounded. If I don’t punish you, then how will I be accountable to the rest of the parents?” May punish based on communal norms, or with due consideration to the expectations of the community. |
| **Examples of how rewards is given** | “I know you deserve praise in public, but I did not want to make your project partners look bad by praising you in front of them.” May give rewards with due consideration of how the community will be affected, or based on what is expected of him as a member of a faith community. |
| **Examples of how money management is done** | “Son, this money is hard to come by. But God wants us to also be generous to others. And remember to tithe as well!” May now become more aware of societal norms, expectations and responsibilities to society and start to incorporate this into the way he manages money and will teach likewise to his children, emphasising that money is a resource to be managed responsibly, such as giving to charity, tithing, stewarding and being generous. |
| **How to encourage them to grow?** | The challenge here is to critically engage with communal parenting norms and values, moving towards a more personalized and nuanced approach to fathering that integrates both personal beliefs and community standards. |

## Stage 4: Integrated Fathering Identity

| Column | Content |
| :------ | :------ |
| **Level of Identity Development** | Stage 4: Integrated Fathering Identity |
| **What they believe** | “I have pondered deeply about what it means to be a godly father.” He has developed a well-defined personal approach to Christian fatherhood. They critically evaluate and integrate various aspects of Christian teachings into a coherent and individualized parenting philosophy. |
| **How they relate with children** | Relationships with children are characterized by authenticity and intentionality. There is a balance between adhering to Christian principles and adapting practices to fit personal and family needs, with a strong sense of personal responsibility in parenting. |
| **Examples of how punishment is conducted** | “What you did deserves punishment. The Bible is clear about this. Hence, I hope this punishment serves to remind you of this lesson.” Draws from various aspects of the Bible in contextualising punishment to the unique demands of the situation. |
| **Examples of how rewards is given** | “You know, the effort you put in is commendable, even though you did not win. God loves the fact that you tried to rely on Him. For that, you deserve a reward.” Draws from various aspects of the Bible in contextualising rewards to the unique demands of the situation. |
| **Examples of how money management is done** | “Son, what does the Bible say about money and wealth? I want you to have your own system of managing money. How you manage money is how you manage your character.” Having developed his own philosophy towards money that is informed by his faith, he actively encourages his children to do likewise. |
| **How to encourage them to grow?** | The focus is on refining and evolving one’s parenting philosophy while engaging thoughtfully with the needs of the family. Fathers aim to model Christian values in a way that is both meaningful and adaptable to changing circumstances. |

## Stage 5: Incarnate Fathering Identity

| Column | Content |
| :------ | :------ |
| **Level of Identity Development** | Stage 5: Incarnate Fathering Identity |
| **What they believe** | “I father my kids as I have been fathered by God the Father.” He embraces a dynamic and evolving understanding of Christian fatherhood based on his own walk as a child of God. He recognizes that his approach to parenting is part of a broader, interconnected journey as a child of God and is open to continuous growth and transformation. |
| **How they relate with children** | Relationships with children are marked by a profound sense of interconnectedness and mutual growth. Fathers seek to foster environments where both they and their children can continuously learn and evolve together within the context of Christian faith. |
| **Examples of how punishment is conducted** | “You deserve to be punished. But in this instance, I will also show mercy, because I remembered being shown mercy when I made the same mistake you did.” Will draw reference from his own experiences being treated by God in the way he metes out punishment. |
| **Examples of how rewards is given** | “Well done! I am going to give you a reward! But before I do that, let us remember that God is already pleased with us as His children. Let’s remember that we don’t need this reward to be reminded of that.” Will draw reference to one’s own evolving identity as a son of God in giving out rewards. |
| **Examples of how money management is done** | “Wah, after so many years, I am still learning about not just money, but wealth and treasures on earth and in heaven. Come son! Tell me what you know so that I can learn from you also.” Realises that as a dad, he is still learning new things regarding how he views and manages treasures on earth and in heaven. Introduces a new humility and openness towards learning and exploring these ideas with his children. |
| **How to encourage them to grow?** | The focus is on embracing the ongoing process of transformation in fathering. Fathers are committed to adapting and growing in their role, seeing parenting as a dynamic and evolving journey that integrates deeper spiritual insights and relational depth. |

# Student Identity & Academic Development

Okay, here is a table illustrating how a student might approach their studies at each of the five levels of identity development, drawing from the provided sources. This framework is adapted from the Christian financial stewardship and fathering identity models, but applied to a student's academic journey.

| Level of Identity Development | Approach to Learning | Motivation for Studying | Handling Challenges | Using Resources | Collaboration with Others | Personal Growth & Reflection |
| :------ | :------ | :------ | :------ | :------ | :------ | :------ |
| **Stage 1: Impulsive** | May not see the need to plan or study consistently; focuses on instant gratification. Studies only when necessary or when facing immediate deadlines. | May not have a clear plan or purpose for studying; driven by immediate needs like passing a test. | Reacts impulsively to challenges; may give up easily or blame others. | Uses resources haphazardly, without a plan. May rely on shortcuts or last-minute cramming | May work alone or only interact with others when they need help. | May not reflect on their learning or growth; focuses on immediate outcomes. |
| **Stage 2: Imperial** | Begins to see studying as a means to an end, such as getting good grades. May follow rules and standards set by teachers, but primarily for personal benefit. | Motivated by external validation like good grades or to meet expectations of parents. May also focus on personal gain. | Handles challenges by enforcing standards on themselves to look good and meet expectations, possibly at the expense of a deeper understanding. | Uses resources to achieve specific goals, such as studying to pass exams, but with a focus on personal benefit. | May collaborate to achieve a better grade, but with a focus on personal benefit. | Begins to see learning as a way to achieve personal goals but may not reflect deeply on the learning process itself. |
| **Stage 3: In-Community** | Becomes more aware of expectations of their learning community (peers, teachers, school) and may incorporate this into their studies. Begins to learn about being responsible with their studies. | May be influenced by their community’s views on achievement. May seek to study and achieve in line with their community's expectations and norms. | Handles challenges in line with community norms, being concerned about their accountability to the school and peers. | Uses resources in line with community expectations. May seek out or be influenced by their peers' study habits. | Collaborates with others to fit in with the expectations of their learning community and to achieve common goals. | Begins to see learning as a way to fulfill societal roles and responsibilities. Begins to reflect on the collective value of education. |
| **Stage 4: Integrated** | Has developed a personal philosophy towards learning that is informed by their personal values and is intentional and reflective. Actively seeks to learn and grow in their understanding of subjects. | Motivated by a genuine desire to learn and grow. Aligns studying with their personal values and goals. Critically evaluates the purpose and value of different aspects of learning. | Handles challenges by drawing from a variety of sources and views in the pursuit of deeper understanding and self-improvement. | Uses resources in a way that aligns with their personal goals and values. May critically evaluate the effectiveness of different resources. | Collaborates with others to enhance their own learning and to contribute to the learning of others. | Actively reflects on their learning process and how it aligns with their personal values. Connects learning to personal development and character. |
| **Stage 5: Incarnate** | Views learning as part of a broader journey of personal growth and development, open to continuous growth and transformation. May have a sense of humility about their knowledge and learning. | Approaches learning with a focus on personal growth, seeing the process as being part of their development and connection with the world. May have a dynamic, evolving view of learning. | Handles challenges with humility and a willingness to learn from mistakes and from others. Draws on previous experience in the same way they would draw on the experience of God's grace and mercy. | Uses resources as a tool for growth and development, with a focus on understanding and application in the world. | Collaborates with others with a focus on mutual learning and growth. Is open to learning from everyone. | Sees learning as an ongoing process of transformation. Actively seeks opportunities to grow through learning. |

**Key points to consider, adapted from the sources:**
*   **Progression:** The stages represent a progression from a self-centered and reactive approach (Stage 1) to a more mature and integrated approach (Stage 5).
*   **Motivations:** The motivations for learning change from external factors to a genuine desire for personal growth and understanding.
*   **Integration:** As a student moves through these stages, their approach to learning becomes more deeply integrated with their values and personal goals.
*   **Personal Growth:** The goal is not just about academic achievement but about personal and intellectual growth within the context of learning.

This table provides a framework for understanding how a student's approach to learning can evolve as they grow and develop.

# The Full Range Leadership Model

The ability to use the full range of leadership behaviors is what separates ineffective from effective leaders. This NebGuide explains the full range of leadership behaviors, transactional and transformational leadership.
*John E. Barbuto, Jr., Associate Professor, Agricultural Leadership, Education and Communication Lance L. Cummins-Brown, Agribusiness Program Coordinator, Department of Agricultural Economics*
The full range leadership model is based more than 100 years of leadership research. It identifies both transactional and transformational behaviors.

**Transactional behaviors** include laissez-faire (hands-off leadership), management-by-exception (putting out the fires) and contingent rewards (let’s make a deal).
**Transformational behaviors** include individualized consideration (compassionate leadership), intellectual stimulation (thinking outside of “the box”), inspirational motivation (exciting the masses/sharing the vision), and idealized influence (walking the walk). Research conducted in Nebraska shows that leaders able to practice these four behaviors tend to gain extra effort from employees, experience higher employee satisfaction and higher productivity and greater organizational effectiveness.

## Transactional Leadership

### Laissez-Faire (Hands-off leadership)
*   Absence of leadership
*   Avoiding taking a stand on issues
*   Doesn’t emphasize results
*   Refraining from intervening when issues arise
*   Unaware of employee performance
*   “That leader doesn’t even care if we do or if we don’t.”

### Management-By-Exception (Putting out the fires)
*   Taking corrective actions
*   Setting standards, but waiting for problems to arise before doing anything
*   Stressing what people are doing wrong
*   Enforcing rules, disliking challenges to the status quo
*   Only hearing from the leader when something is wrong
*   “Uh oh, here he/she comes again!”

### Contingent Rewards (Let’s make a deal!)
*   Applying constructive transactions
*   Making clear expectations of outcomes and rewards
*   Exchanging reward and recognition for accomplishments
*   Actively monitoring employee’s progress and providing supportive feedback
*   “If you do as we agreed, you’ll get the reward.”

## Transformational Leadership

### Individualized Consideration (Compassionate leader)
*   Empathizing with individual needs
*   Making interpersonal connections with employees
*   Genuinely caring and showing this compassion in actions
*   Encouraging continuous development and growth of employees
*   Sending the message, “I care about you and am looking out for your best interest”

### Intellectual Stimulation (Thinking outside of the box)
*   Encouraging the imagination of employees
*   Challenging the old ways of doing things
*   Looking for better ways to do things
*   Encouraging followers not to think like him/her
*   Willing to take risks for potential gains
*   Sending the message, “If we change our assumptions, then ...”

### Inspirational Motivation (Exciting the masses/Sharing the vision)
*   Inspiring others to perform
*   Clarifying where the organization will be in the future
*   Creating a strong sense of purpose among employees
*   Aligning individual and organizational needs
*   Helping followers achieve more than even they thought was possible
*   Sending the message, “If we focus on what this organization stands for we can achieve whatever we desire!”

### Idealized Influence (Actions speak louder than words)
*   Demonstrating an inclusive vision
*   Walking the walk
*   Exhibiting great commitment and persistence in pursuing objectives
*   Expressing confidence in the vision of the organization
*   Developing trust and confidence among employees
*   Symbolizing the goals and mission of the organization
*   Sending the message, “I believe that this is truly the right thing to do”

The chart above illustrates the full range of leadership behaviors.
Laissez-faire (LF) is the most inactive and generally least effective of the leader behaviors. Research shows that leaders using this style of leadership are rarely viewed as effective on the job.
Management-by-exception (MBE) is more effective than laissez-faire, but is generally ineffective leadership.
Management-by-exception behavior often is related to high employee turnover and absenteeism, poor satisfaction and poor perception of organizational effectiveness.
Contingent rewards (CR) can be an effective style of leadership. However, leaders will not get more than they bargain for when practicing this style of leadership.
It is only with the remaining four behaviors that leaders are able to motivate followers to perform above expectations and transcend their own self-interest for the sake of the organization.
The four — individualized consideration (IC), intellectual stimulation (IS), inspirational motivation (IM), and idealized influence (II) — all have resulted in extra effort from workers, higher productivity, higher morale and satisfaction, higher organizational effectiveness, lower turnover, lower absenteeism and greater organizational adaptability to changes in the environment.
Leaders are generally most effective when they regularly use each of the four transformational behaviors (individualized consideration, intellectual stimulation, inspirational motivation and idealized influence) to build on contingent rewards.
