# PDFs Directory

Place your PDF files in this directory to make them available in the Materials tab.

## How it works

- Any PDF file placed in this folder will automatically appear in the Materials page
- The app will read PDF filenames and display them as clickable items
- When clicked, PDFs open in a modal overlay for easy reading
- Files are served securely through Next.js API routes

## File naming tips

- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `emotional-intelligence-guide.pdf`)
- Avoid special characters in filenames
- Use hyphens or underscores instead of spaces
